What we just did was to use a so-called _for-loop_, probably the most common way to repeat things in Python. \n",

If only one number `n` is provided to `range(n)`, it will enumerate all numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If two arguments are provided, the first one determines the starting number, and the second one stands for the terminating number minus one---confusing, right? So, in order to enumerate all numbers from 1 to 10, we have to write `range(1,11)`. Finally, the `print` function outputs the value of `i` for each iteration.
